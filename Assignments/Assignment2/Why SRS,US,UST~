For the development of our project, we would be using SRS, Use Cases and User stories. I think that SRS/Use cases and user stories gives as an agile approach. It helps us to make a weel-planned plan on how to figure hwat are the functional and what are the non-functional requirements of the application. We are able to know about what all features we need in our application and how to go about implementing all of them.
